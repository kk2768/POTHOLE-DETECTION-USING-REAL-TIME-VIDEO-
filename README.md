# POTHOLE-DETECTION-USING-REAL-TIME-VIDEO-
Effective pothole detection is crucial for ensuring road safety and maintaining infrastructure, as potholes pose significant risks to both vehicles and drivers. Most conventional pothole inspection methods rely on time-consuming and costly methods involving specialized equipment or manual surveys, making them quite unsuitable for scaled and adaptive applications. The recent development in machine vision and improvement in deep learning algorithms brought into mainstream applications the use of cost-effective, efficient automated pothole detection solutions. This presents a novel approach for real-time pothole detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the framework of YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once, version 4), a state-of-the-art object detection model renowned for its speed and accuracy. By integrating YOLOv4 with NMS and OpenCV, our approach continuously processes streams of videos coming from the vehicle-mounted cameras and has high accuracy for detecting and classifying potholes over a range of road types, lighting conditions, and weather environments. The architecture of YOLOv4 makes it facilitate very fast detection and identification of potholes in a frame while NMS filters out redundant detection values and refines these most relevant for further consideration, feature extraction, and subsequently classification. A test is conducted on a video dataset simulating real scenarios of road conditions in the real world to validate effectiveness. The results indicate that our approach not only successfully detects potholes but is also efficient enough to be used in real time, and thus, can be implemented on a city-wide basis for road monitoring and maintenance. It can be easily implemented in smart city infrastructure wherein it can alert the concerned maintenance teams on time to avoid damage to vehicles and optimize schedules for road repair, and ultimately, road safety will be improved as a whole. This approach is of paramount importance because it minimizes the use of expensive apparatus, increases the sensitivity to detection, and facilitates wider application due to its versatility and effectiveness in a range of conditions.
