# POTHOLE-DETECTION-USING-REAL-TIME-VIDEO-
Effective pothole detection ensures road safety and infrastructure maintenance. We propose a real-time, cost-effective solution using YOLOv4 and OpenCV to detect potholes from vehicle-mounted video streams. This method offers high accuracy across various conditions and enables scalable deployment for smart city road monitoring.
